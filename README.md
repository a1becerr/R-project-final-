 Scientific question: Are there conserved proteins/protein coding genes and protein kinases between humans and primates that function similarly to cause cancer? If so, then do these conserved proteins lead to similar pathways in both organisms , such as ALU units from BRCA1 or Casp2s' regulation on autophagy?
All of my fasta files that I included need to be extracted and shortened untill each of them are roughly 10,000 characters in length. The data is taken from the NCBI database just input the name of each of my subjects (BRCA1/CASPS2/CHEK1) and then get the data for homosapiens and in gorillas for a total of 6 fasta files. 
After that there are a few packages that need to be installed of of which are listed in my notebook in order for the code to run properly.
